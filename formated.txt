Regular Expressions is a textual pattern used to search in text.
 You do so by "matching" the regular expression against the text.
 The result of matching a regular expression against a text is either a true / false value,  specifying if the regular expression matched the text, or a set of matches-one match for every occurrence of the regular expression found in the text.
 For instance, you could use a regular expression to search an HTML page for email addresses,  URLs, telephone numbers etc.
 This would be done by matching different regular expressions against the HTML page.
 The result of matching each regular expression against the HTML page would be a set of matches-one set of matches for each regular expression(each regular expression may match more than one time).
 Matching regular expressions against text is exactly what you can do with Java regex-the Java regular expression API.
